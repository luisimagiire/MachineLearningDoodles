# Machine Learning Doodles

Project to implement the bare bones of different machine learning algorithms 
that I am interest in.
The objective is not to have the most efficient way of doing it, but to capture
the most basic essence of each one.

ROADMAP(?):
 * k-nn [DONE]
 * EM algorithm [DONE]
 * Gibbs Sampling [DONE]
 * Metropolis Hasting
